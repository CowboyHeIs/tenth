# Questions
1. Explain the benefits of using JavaScript in developing web applications.
2. Explain why we need to use 'await' when we call 'fetch()'. What would happen if we don't use 'await'?
3. Why do we need to use the 'csrf_exempt' decorator on the view used for AJAX POST?
4. On this week's tutorial, the user input sanitization is done in the back-end as well. Why can't the sanitization be done just in the front-end?
5. Explain how you implemented the checklist above step-by-step (not just following the tutorial).


# Short Answers

1. JavaScript: interactivity, async, client-sided.
2. 'await': fetch resolution. No 'await': promise only.
3. 'csrf_exempt': no CSRF tokens in AJAX POST.
4. Frontend: bypassed; backend: secure.
5. Understandings non-existent, following hard. Consultations results 'False'. Confused > No questions > No understad > No result.
